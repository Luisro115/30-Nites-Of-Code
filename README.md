# 30-Nites-Of-Code
Found the motivation to tackle coding again after a while in hiatus.
About me:
-My Father is a brilliant programmer and is the one who has always been there for me when it comes to coding so I would love to make him proud.
-A big fan of TCG's 
-Used to dream of making my own Game engine when I was 14.
Now with this its time to take control of my destiny!
